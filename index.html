            <h1>Club Overview</h1>
            <h2>
                The Environment Club at Burnside High School is open to all students across every year level who want to make a difference, meet new people, and learn how to care for the world around them. We meet every Wednesday after school from 2:30 PM to around 3:30 to 4:00 PM, where we work on a range of hands-on activities including planting trees and native plants, cleaning and maintaining the school grounds, and looking after our school garden. Beyond our regular meetings, we also take part in larger community and environmental events such as tree planting days, Earth Day activities, and sustainability campaigns that raise awareness about recycling, waste reduction, and climate change. Members of the club have the chance to gain valuable skills in teamwork and leadership while contributing to both the school and the wider community. Whether you are passionate about protecting the environment or simply want to get involved in something positive, the Environment Club welcomes everyone to join in building a greener, more sustainable future together.

                <h1>Where to go</h1>
                <h2>
                    The Environment Club meets at the back field by P Block, just past the bike shed. We begin each session by gathering as a group and discussing the days plan before heading out to our project location. Depending on the week, we might work along the riverbanks, tend to the garden by the lower field, or head over to Jellie Park to plant trees and native plants along the riverbed. Other times, we stay around the school grounds to collect litter, maintain garden spaces, and help keep the campus green and welcoming. Each meeting is a chance to get outdoors, connect with others, and contribute to projects that make a lasting, positive impact on both our school and local environment.
